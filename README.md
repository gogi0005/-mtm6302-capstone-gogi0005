Use jQuery to load data from the Pokemon API and create cards for each Pokemon.
Add a click event to each "View Details" button on the Pokemon cards, which opens a pop-up window with more information about the selected Pokemon.
Add a "Catch" button and a "Release" button to the pop-up window, which change the text of the "Catch" button and disable it when clicked.
Add a click event to the "Load More" button, which loads more data from the Pokemon API and creates additional cards.
Add CSS animation and a gradient background to the main page to make it more visually appealing.
Add a footer to the main page with a Pokemon logo and a "Powered by" message.

Figuring out the correct API endpoint and parameters to use for loading data.
Creating a pop-up window with dynamic content that changes based on the selected Pokemon.
Ensuring that the "Load More" button only loads data once, and preventing it from loading data while other data is still loading.
Balancing the layout and design of the main page to make it visually appealing while still maintaining functionality.
Overall, this prototype was a good learning experience for working with APIs and creating dynamic content using JavaScript and jQuery.
